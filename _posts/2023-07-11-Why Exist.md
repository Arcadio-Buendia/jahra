The last novel I read was Metamorphosis and the current one is Nausea. 

In the previous one, I atleast had the consolation of something non-real happening. Even when it was in the most earnest of tones and felt like something that had actually happened in a not so far away country. It was still something that I knew deep down to be unreal. The emotions however very much real and those that I have felt over and over again. The book cannot be easily described but it was something that leaves an imprint.

Nuasea on the other hand is simply dull by nature and doesn't feel like a novel. This is probably more becuase of my taste in novels that have made me read the likes of Asimov, Rowling and Huessini. Nausea feels like a chat with a friend who talks slowly after pondering over words. Who has his own pace and you must wait for you know the wait will be worth it. The mundane can be seen by you in the most unexpected angle and be engrossed in the conversation. Till you feel like life itself a nausea.
