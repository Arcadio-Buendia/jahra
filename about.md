I am starting this blog at 00:00 on 12th July 2023.
Highlights of the day:
 - Read the scanned copy of an old document from the British Library. This sort of thing reminds me of the futility of existence. Those people who wrote and signed on the document were one of the most important people of their age. Their thoughts and deeds live on and so do their names but it is only in the living mind that they do. There is no essence or spine to their existence. But is there any essence to ours. Or is it just Nausea.
